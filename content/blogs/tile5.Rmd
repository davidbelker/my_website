## Tic Tac Toe battles

#### Here, you can see two AIs play Tic Tac Toe against each other. These two AIs are quite stupid as you can see from their moves (all their moves are random).
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ttt(ttt_ai(), ttt_ai())
```

#### Now let's make one AI intelligent and see what happens.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ttt(ttt_ai(level = 1), ttt_ai(level = 4))
```

#### For the final battle, I will make them both equally clever. Let the games begin!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ttt(ttt_ai(level = 4), ttt_ai(level = 4))
```
