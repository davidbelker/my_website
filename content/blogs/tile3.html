<p>An inverted yield curve does seem like a good predictor of recessions. Almost every time the spread between the 10y and the 3m Treasury became negative, a recession followed. This is certainly true for the big crises in the 80s, the Dotcom burst and the Lehman catastrophe. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic the yield curve was inverted. Every single inversion since 1999 preceded a recession.</p>
